                     <p>A new coffee is arriving for Starbucks Reserve and we are delighted to share it with you. Ka¡¯u coffee takes its name from the Ka¡¯u district on the Big Island of Hawaii. The Ka¡¯u region is located on the slopes of the volcano Mauna Loa. The area was traditionally used for growing sugar cane, but after the exodus of sugar plantations the soil was well-suited to grow coffee. With over 2,000 acres of prime land in the district of Ka¡¯u there are approximately 280 acres planted and worked by about 40 farmers. Here Ka¡¯u coffee is quietly transforming this small region into a world-class coffee source that¡¯s gaining attention.</p>

                     <p>Recent reports tell us that a quarter of U.S. students do not graduate from high school on time. For young people of color, this number is close to 40 percent.</p>

            <p>Sadly, it is not news that fewer and fewer of us in the U.S. successfully graduate. Nor is it news that America¡¯s educational system must better address the 21st century needs of our citizens. It¡¯s a huge task that no single entity can change.</p>

            <p>Starbucks is committed to being a catalyst for change by leveraging our stores, our partners and the connection we have with our customers. Through our Youth Action Grants, we¡¯ve supported young people in the U.S. and around the world in taking action to address needs in their local communities. We¡¯ve mobilized thousands of Starbucks partners and customers to make a difference by doing community service to improve their local schools and revitalize local parks.</p>
