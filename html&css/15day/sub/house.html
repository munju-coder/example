    <p>Times Square has been long deserving of a Starbucks that blends in with the bright lights, non-stop activity and unique buzz of the neighborhood. We¡¯re really excited to announce that last month we opened a new store at the corner of 47th and Broadway. It is designed to look and feel like one of the nearby Broadway Theaters.</p>

    <p>Design has always inspired us, ever since we first opened our doors in Pike Place Market 40 years ago. Since then, our coffee and our culture have progressed with the times, and our evolved Siren has made its way into neighborhoods all across the world ? making its most recent design debut this year.</p>
    
    <p>As a frequent collaborator with the design and artist community, we are proud to team up with and contribute to the CFDA/VOGUE FASHION FUND (CVFF), an esteemed organization that gives annual grants that provide resources to support and encourage the goals of emerging American fashion designers. Alongside the CVFF, we were thrilled to invite the past three winners, Alexander Wang (2008), Sophie Theallet (2009) and Billy Reid (2010) to create signature, limited-edition designer T-shirts inspired by Starbucks and their personal experience with our brand and our coffee over the years.</p>
